This program will display the total number of grades, average grade among those grades, 
and percentage of grades that fall above the average based on a file with grades. 
The program will first open the grades file called final.txt

Based of the list, the program will then display the total number of grades in the list depending on how many 
grades there are, which should be 24.
Next, we will calculate the avergae grade of the grades in list and the program will display the percentage, which
should be 83.25%.

the percentage of grades above the average.
